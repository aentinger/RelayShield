# 📂 Description

The LXRobotics Relay Shield allows to independently switch up to different 4 loads. The switching of any relay is signalised by its own red status LED. High quality screw terminals ensure stable and durable connections. For an quick and easy start, a open source Arduino library with sample programs is available.

**Features**

* Potential-free switching of up to 4 different loads through 4 relays/contactors
* Max. current per relay: 10 A
* Max. voltage DC per relay: 24 V DC
* Max voltage AC per relay: 250 V AC
* Relay type: SPDT (Single Pole commutator)
* Red LED's shows relay status (ON/OFF)
* Optocouplers used to isolate relay circuit from Arduino 
* High quality screw terminals
* Arduino Library with example programs is available on GitHub
